            This short story was created for the Fall 2023 semester of Fiction Writing Workshop with Professor Sanz. This story
            follows Fabian, a cursed ex-bard, who struggles with an inner demon that he fears will tear apart his life.<br /><br />

            Heavily inspired by Dungeons & Dragons, this story manifested when I wondered what would happen if a character
            left their party because of a horrible curse he feared would put them in danger. I can certainly see my growth
            since this story, and I've thought of ways I could improve the comedy, combat, and description in future pieces
            like this one.
