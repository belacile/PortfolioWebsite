                Final Portfolio Reflection and "Compliance"
            </a>
            <br /><br />
            This short story was created for the Spring 2024 semester of Advanced Fiction Writing Workshop with Professor<br />
            Brown. This story follows the struggle of a computer science student, along with his sidekick Ducky, who<br />
            procrastinates on a difficult coding assignment until the code starts speaking back to him.<br /><br />

            The Final Portfolio Reflection is a reflection on my peers' critique of "Compliance," addressed to Professor Brown,<br />
            and includes a revised version of the story.
