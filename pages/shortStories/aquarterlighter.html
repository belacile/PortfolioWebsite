            This short story was created for the Fall 2023 semester of Fiction Writing Workshop with Professor Sanz. This story<br />
            follows two young boys in the 1980s as they attempt to get their hands on fireworks<br /><br />

            Inspired by events from my father's childhood, I am proud of the relationship between the two protagonists in "A<br />
            Quarter Lighter" despite the anticlimactic ending. The relationships feel real and full of life, even if I wish the ending<br />
            was more impactful.
