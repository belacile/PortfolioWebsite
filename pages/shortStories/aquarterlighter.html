            This short story was created for the Fall 2023 semester of Fiction Writing Workshop with Professor Sanz. This story
            follows two young boys in the 1980s as they attempt to get their hands on fireworks.<br /><br />

            Inspired by events from my father's childhood, I am proud of the relationship between the two protagonists in "A
            Quarter Lighter" despite the anticlimactic ending. The relationships feel real and full of life, even if I wish the ending<br />
            was more impactful.
