                "Do Not Forsake Me"
            </a>
            <br /><br />
            This short story was created for the Spring 2024 semester of Advanced Fiction Writing Workshop with Professor<br />
            Brown. This story follows a pumpkin-man named Kynn as he attempts to bring back a pet from the dead as the past<br />
            catches up with him.<br /><br />

            Although "Do Not Forsake Me" has its flaws, it was the most well-recieved story among my peers&mdash;some even<br />
            staying after class to ask me detailed questions about the strange fantasy world I created for this story.
