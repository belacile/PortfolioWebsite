            This Narrative Game Design Document (GDD) was created for the Fall 2024 semester of Writing for Video
            Games with Professor Telep. Taught with the tight deadlines of the video game industry in mind, students of this
            class were required to complete both an individual and group GDD at the same time. This is my group GDD from
            this class with a team we titled the Mystery Buggy Buddies (otherwise known as Team 4).<br /><br />

            <h3>Team 4 Members:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Caitlyn Chilelli</li>
                <li>Chris Hiler</li>
                <li>Maria Matthews</li>
                <li>Mathew Powell</li>
                <li>Caleb Rosenfeld</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            All of the team contributed about equally to the ideas behind <i>Lamplight</i>, however, within the document itself,
            I contributed the title, razor statement, focus paragram, and the world section of the text.
            <br /><br />

            <h3>Razor Statement:</h3>
        <pre>
    <i>Lamplight</i> is a whimsical point-and-click adventure mystery game where the player plays
    as a moth detective named Merlock Moth who is trying to solve the murder of Timmy
    Termite, a demolition expert. Merlock explores the city to interrogate insect suspects,
    find clues, and exonerate himself

            <h3>Focus Paragraph:</h3>
        <pre>
        <i>Lamplight</i> is a whimsical point-and-click adventure mystery game where the player plays
        as a moth detective named Merlock Moth who is trying to solve the mystery of Timmy
        Termite, a demolition expert who was mysteriously killed in Merlock’s office. Merlock
        explores Buzzburg, a bug-inhabited city inside of an abandoned trash can, in order to
        interrogate suspects including an ant construction worker, a queen bee barkeep, a ladybug
        idol, a centipede scientist, and a firefly firefighter. The player will traverse the three
        levels of Buzzburg—the Upper Metamorphosociety, the middle Carapace Corner, and the
        lower Mafia-controlled Spider-Square Slums—to try to solve the murder and clear
        Merlock’s name.
