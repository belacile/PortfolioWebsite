                <i>Wildcards</i> Narrative GDD PDF
            </a>
            <br /><br />
            This Narrative Game Design Document (GDD) was created for the Fall 2024 semester of Writing for Video Games
            with Professor Telep. Taught with the tight deadlines of the video game industry in mind, students of this class were
            required to complete both an individual and group GDD at the same time. This is my individual GDD from this
            class, and I hope to someday make a functioning prototype of what this game could look like.<br /><br />

        <pre>
    <i>Wildcards</i> is an innovative turn-based RPG set in a fictionalized Wild West where 
    the player plays as Grift—a washed-up gambler who discovers a cursed deck of cards, 
    accidentally unleashing evil spirits upon the entire American Frontier. Throughout the 
    game, the cards will reveal themselves to Grift and allies he’ll meet along the way, 
    adding to the player’s arsenal of abilities to defeat the evil spirits and make the West a 
    little less wild.

            <h3>Focus Paragraph:</h3>
        </p>
        <pre>
        <i>Wildcards</i> is an innovative turn-based RPG set in The Alvida Territory, a part of a 
        fictionalized 1800s American Frontier, that is soon ravaged by evil spirits when the 
        protagonist, Grift—a washed-up gambler struggling to get back on his feet—discovers a 
        cursed deck of cards. He soon learns that gambling with the dead is more dangerous 
        than he assumed when the spirits begin to infest the wilderness, more bloodthirsty than 
        the typical bandits, coyotes, and rattlesnakes of old. Wracked with guilt, Grift recruits his 
        brother-in-law, a Native American conservationist and hunter, to fix the damages and 
        protect his estranged daughter, Leeshy. Together, they venture forth to put the spirits 
        back where they belong, recruiting new allies and discovering the true nature of the 
        magic cards, both of which add to the player’s arsenal of abilities to defeat the evil 
        spirits. As the game progresses, Grift finally learns to take responsibility for his actions 
        and to make things right with his daughter and the rest of the West.
