            This Narrative Game Design Document (GDD) was created for the Fall 2024 semester of Writing for Video<br />
            Games with Professor Telep. Taught with the tight deadlines of the video game industry in mind, students of this<br />
            class were required to complete both an individual and group GDD at the same time. This is my group GDD from<br />
            this class with a team we titled the Mystery Buggy Buddies (otherwise known as Team 4).<br /><br />

            Team 4 Members:
            <ul>
                <li>Caitlyn Chilelli</li>
                <li>Chris Hiler</li>
                <li>Maria Matthews</li>
                <li>Mathew Powell</li>
                <li>Caleb Rosenfeld</li>
            </ul>
            All of the team contributed about equally to the ideas behind the <i>Lamplight</i>, however, within the document itself,<br />
            I contributed the title, razor statement, focus paragram, and the world section of the text.

            &emsp; Razor Statement:

            <i>Lamplight</i> is a whimsical point-and-click adventure mystery game where the player plays
            as a moth detective named Merlock Moth who is trying to solve the murder of Timmy
            Termite, a demolition expert. Merlock explores the city to interrogate insect suspects,
            find clues, and exonerate himself

            <i>Lamplight</i> is a whimsical point-and-click adventure mystery game where the player plays
            as a moth detective named Merlock Moth who is trying to solve the mystery of Timmy
            Termite, a demolition expert who was mysteriously killed in Merlock’s office. Merlock
            explores Buzzburg, a bug-inhabited city inside of an abandoned trash can, in order to
            interrogate suspects including an ant construction worker, a queen bee barkeep, a ladybug
            idol, a centipede scientist, and a firefly firefighter. The player will traverse the three
            levels of Buzzburg—the Upper Metamorphosociety, the middle Carapace Corner, and the
            lower Mafia-controlled Spider-Square Slums—to try to solve the murder and clear
            Merlock’s name.
