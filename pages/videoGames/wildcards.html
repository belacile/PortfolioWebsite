                <i>Wildcards</i> Narrative GDD PDF
            </a>
            <br /><br />
            This Narrative Game Design Document (GDD) was created for the Fall 2024 semester of Writing for Video Games<br />
            with Professor Telep. Taught with the tight deadlines of the video game industry in mind, students of this class were<br />
            required to complete both an individual and group GDD at the same time. This is my individual GDD from this<br />
            class, and I hope to someday make a functioning prototype of what this game could look like.<br /><br />

        <pre>
            <i>Wildcards</i> is an innovative turn-based RPG set in a fictionalized Wild West where 
            the player plays as Grift—a washed-up gambler who discovers a cursed deck of cards, 
            accidentally unleashing evil spirits upon the entire American Frontier. Throughout the 
            game, the cards will reveal themselves to Grift and allies he’ll meet along the way, 
            adding to the player’s arsenal of abilities to defeat the evil spirits and make the West a 
            little less wild.

        <pre>
            <i>Wildcards</i> is an innovative turn-based RPG set in The Alvida Territory, a part of a 
            fictionalized 1800s American Frontier, that is soon ravaged by evil spirits when the 
            protagonist, Grift—a washed-up gambler struggling to get back on his feet—discovers a 
            cursed deck of cards. He soon learns that gambling with the dead is more dangerous 
            than he assumed when the spirits begin to infest the wilderness, more bloodthirsty than 
            the typical bandits, coyotes, and rattlesnakes of old. Wracked with guilt, Grift recruits his 
            brother-in-law, a Native American conservationist and hunter, to fix the damages and 
            protect his estranged daughter, Leeshy. Together, they venture forth to put the spirits 
            back where they belong, recruiting new allies and discovering the true nature of the 
            magic cards, both of which add to the player’s arsenal of abilities to defeat the evil 
            spirits. As the game progresses, Grift finally learns to take responsibility for his actions 
            and to make things right with his daughter and the rest of the West.
