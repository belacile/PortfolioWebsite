            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p class="intro">
                Hello and welcome to my portfolio! Let me take your coat and hat before we sit down.<br />
                Would you like anything to drink? A glass of water? A soda?<br />
                Is that chair too firm? Here, I have a pillow to help out a bit.<br />
                Alright, now that we're seated, it's nice to meet you!<br /><br />
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm Caleb Rosenfeld&mdash;a writer, coder, game developer, video editor, and amateur artist.<br /><br />
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been taking college classes since I started dual enrolling at fifteen years old back in the fall semester of
                2019. Now that I am twenty-one, I have been commited to writing and coding seriously for six and three years respectively.<br /><br />

                However, even before this, I possessed a creative and academic mind, always striving to learn new things. I have<br />
                attempted many creative outlets ranging from simple digital art to crafting entire Youtube videos. However,<br />
                I discovered my love for storytelling at age fifteen when I wrote a character backstory for my first ever game of<br />
                Dungeons and Dragons&mdash;or D&D for short. The game sparked my imagination, and inspired me to pursue<br />
                storytelling as my hobby. To this day, I still play (and Dungeon Master) as often as I'm able, and it has made me<br />
                extremely confident in my skills as a collaborative storyteller. In D&D, every voice at the table contributes to the<br />
                greater narrative, guiding the story in ways that no single person at the table could possibly conceive on our own.<br /><br />

                Although my desire to tell stories of quests and monsters has remained indomitable, I still decided to pursue<br />
                Computer Science in college, as this would teach me many skills that would help me satiate the other side of my<br />
                brain&mdash;the side that loves math, puzzles, and abstract problem-solving. Interestingly enough, a good portion of<br />
                my love of problem-solving comes from video game puzzles. Games that really scratched this itch for me from a<br />
                young age were <i>Portal 2</i>, <i>Monument Valley</i>, and all of the LEGO video games.
